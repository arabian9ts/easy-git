easy-git
======================
This project is imitation of git.  
I'm trying to make it easy to use version control.  
This works on macOS.


Usage
------
Download zip or evaluate next...  
After that, build project and put product in where the path is through.  
Then, move to your project directory.

### Initialize ###
    eat init


### Add ###
    eat add file1 dir1 file2 ...    // this means "git add file1 fir1 ..."
    eat add ./    // this means "git add ."


### Commit ###
    eat commit    // this means "git commit"
    // After you evaluate this, you could type commit message.


### Log ###
    eat log   // this means "git log"
